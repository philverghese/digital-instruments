# Digital Instruments
Fly with Lua plugin for X-Plane that gives digital readings of analog instruments. Some of the analog HSI and CDI instruments are hard to set precisely.

# Installing
1. Install [Fly With Lua NG](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/38445-flywithlua-ng-next-generation-edition-for-x-plane-11-win-lin-mac/).
  - Click the "Download this file" button on the right side
  - Extract the zip. Copy the `FlyWithLua` directory to your `X-Plane 11\Resources\plugins` directory
2. Delete the file `X-Plane 11\Resources\plugins\FlyWithLua\Scripts\please read the manual.lua`. You don't need the manual (well, not right now).
3. Copy `digital-instruments.lua` from this page to `X-Plane 11\Resources\plugins\FlyWithLua\Scripts`

# Using
A little window showing information from Nav1 and Nav2 will appear. If you close it by mistake, you can re-open it with the menus: Plugins > FlyWithLua Macros > Toggle digital instruments window.

You can bind a key or button to the X-Plane command `FlyWithLua/digital-instruments/toggle_window` to toggle the window.
